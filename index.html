    <h1>Integrity is one of the three
building blocks of information
security. Integrity ensure that a
users data is real not tampered
with by unauthorized source.
Companies use integrity to stay
reliable. So that the information
being displayed is completely
authentic. Integrity makes sure
that when a sender writes
something the receiver receives
the exact same message. Without
integrity information could be
changed and the receiver could
falsely interpret the information
causing a headache of problems.</h1>
